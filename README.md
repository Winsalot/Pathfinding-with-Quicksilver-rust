# Pathfinding-with-Quicksilver-rust

Small interactive project that tests various pathfinding algorithms. Made in rust with [Quicksilver](https://crates.io/crates/quicksilver) crate.

Since I am working towards [my own RTS engine & game](https://github.com/Winsalot/AutumnRTS)  I started this micro project to get more familiar with various pathfinding algorithms and their implementations. At the same time I wanted to give a try for Quicksilver game engine.

Right now it only shows implementation of A* from [pathfinding](https://crates.io/crates/pathfinding) crate, but in the future it will probably include more algorithms to try and compare.
